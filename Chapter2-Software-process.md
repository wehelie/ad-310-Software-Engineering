- In practice, most practical process include elements of both plan-driven and agile approaches.
- There are no right or wrong software processes.


### Software Process models

- The waterfall model
  - Plan-driven model. Separate and distinct phases of specification and development.
  - The waterfall model is mostly used for large systems Engineering projects where a system is developed at several sites.
    - In those circumstances, the plan-driven nature of the waterfall model helps coordinate the work.
